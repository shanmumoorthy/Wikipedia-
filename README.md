Answer the following
1)Shortcut:
    html:5
2)The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. It ensures that the browser renders the page in standards mode.
3)Void elements are HTML elements that do not have a closing tag(self-closing). Examples include <img>, <br>, <hr>, <input>, and <meta>.
4)Differences:
*Elements are the building blocks of HTML (e.g., <div>, <p>, <a>). They define structure and content.
*Attributes provide additional information about elements (e.g., href in <a href="url">).
5)HTML entries are special characters that are reserved in HTML, represented by codes (e.g., &lt; for <, &amp; for &). They ensure correct display of characters.
6)Meta tags provide metadata(data about data) about the HTML document, such as description, keywords, author, and viewport settings. They're used for SEO, browser behavior, and responsive design.
7)*Use the <img> tag with attributes like src, alt, width, and height.
*Ensure images are optimized for web performance by compressing them and using responsive design techniques like srcset for different resolutions.
